# Down with Society

This is a game made at a gamejam.

## Improvements

### Must haves

- constructions fade in based on progress
- fix sound so it repeats

### Nice to have

- a factory (art, with a few transparancy levels)
- a larger bike (art)
- a park (art, with a few transparancy levels)
- a rock
- road/ tarmac
- building start sound
- building destroy sound
- sound to reflect gameplay state if possible
- fix damping so it's slower than reverse speed
- more than 2 players
