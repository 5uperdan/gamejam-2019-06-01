# Down with Society

This is a game made at a gamejam.

## Improvements

### Must haves

- constructions fade in based on progress
- keep win screen for longer
- fix sound so it repeats
- a larger bike (art)
- a factory (art)
- a park (art)

### Nice to have

- controller support
- fix collision detection across multiple cells
- building start sound
- building destroy sound
- sound to reflect gameplay state if possible
- fix damping so it's slower than reverse speed
- more than 2 players
